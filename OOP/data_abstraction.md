# Data Abstraction in Python

## Definition

Data abstraction is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that focuses on hiding the implementation details and exposing only the necessary parts of an object. This allows users to work with high-level functionalities without needing to understand the underlying logic.

In Python, abstraction is typically achieved using **abstract classes** and **abstract methods** from the `abc` module. These help enforce a structured design, ensuring that subclasses implement specific behaviors.

## Why is Abstraction Important?

1. **Encapsulation of Complexity:** Users interact with only essential details while the complex logic remains hidden.
2. **Code Reusability:** Abstract classes provide a blueprint for multiple subclasses, avoiding redundant code.
3. **Security:** Sensitive data or logic can be protected from direct modification.
4. **Flexibility and Scalability:** Developers can create new implementations without modifying existing code.

## Implementation of Abstraction in Python

Abstraction in Python is implemented through **Abstract Base Classes (ABCs)**. These classes define methods that must be implemented by any subclass.

### Example:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Vehicle(ABC):  # Abstract class
    @abstractmethod
    def start_engine(self):
        pass  # Abstract method, must be implemented by subclasses

    def fuel_type(self):
        return "Petrol or Diesel"  # Normal method, can be used directly

class Car(Vehicle):
    def start_engine(self):
        return "Car engine started"

class Bike(Vehicle):
    def start_engine(self):
        return "Bike engine started"

# Trying to instantiate Vehicle directly will raise an error
# vehicle = Vehicle()  # TypeError: Can't instantiate abstract class

car = Car()
bike = Bike()
print(car.start_engine())  # Output: Car engine started
print(bike.start_engine())  # Output: Bike engine started
```

## Types of Abstraction

Abstraction can be classified into two types:

### 1. **Partial Abstraction**

In **partial abstraction**, the abstract class contains both abstract and concrete (normal) methods. This allows some default behaviors while still enforcing specific implementations in subclasses.

Example:

```python
class Appliance(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def power_on(self):
        pass

    def warranty(self):
        return "1-year warranty"
```

Here, `power_on()` must be implemented by subclasses, but `warranty()` is already defined.

### 2. **Full Abstraction**

In **full abstraction**, the abstract class contains only abstract methods, meaning every method must be implemented by the subclass.

Example:

```python
class Shape(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def area(self):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def perimeter(self):
        pass
```

Here, both `area()` and `perimeter()` **must** be implemented by subclasses, enforcing complete abstraction.

## Why Does the Definition Mention Hiding Details, but the Implementation Enforces Structure?

The definition emphasizes hiding unnecessary details from users, but in Python’s implementation, abstraction is mainly about enforcing structure. This is because:

- Abstract classes define the required methods but do not specify how they work. Subclasses must provide their own implementations, which effectively hides the internal logic from users interacting with the base class.
- This ensures that abstraction is not just about hiding details but also about maintaining a consistent design pattern across multiple implementations.

## Conclusion

- **Abstraction** is about simplifying interactions with objects by hiding complexities.
- **Abstract classes** provide a structured way to enforce method implementations.
- **Partial abstraction** allows some concrete methods in the parent class, while **full abstraction** requires all methods to be abstract.
- Python’s abstraction enforces structure while still supporting the idea of hiding unnecessary details.

This documentation should help clarify both the definition and the implementation of abstraction in Python. Feel free to include it in your repository!
